# Second version

In comparison to the previous version, I'm using a simpler/better data source, so that I don't need machine learning to fill empty records.

The current status is summarized [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/astyonax/machine-learning-paris-flat/blob/master/v2/rendered/LBC-simple.html), together with the 

1. web-scraping code
2. data-cleaning and analysis code
3. plots of some results

The map can be visualized only running the *ipython ntoebook*: [LBC--simple](LBC-simple.ipynb)
